# Quiet Accounts — build status

Updated every loop iteration. Newest first.

## 2026-09-29 — iteration 1

**Done and green**
- Engine (`packages/engine`): ingest (Jobber/HCP/ServiceTitan/QuickBooks/any CSV), 12 breakage detectors,
  11 suppressions, scoring, forecast + fit check, 20 trade playbooks, note library + quality gate,
  cadence planner, reply reader (inbox), ledger/attribution with holdout lift, owner reports, runtime agents,
  simulator, sample generator. 405 tests pass; `tsc` clean.
- Server (`apps/server`): SQLite store, API, worker, webhooks (Instantly, inbound email, owner SMS, Jobber),
  Jobber OAuth + GraphQL sync + note write-back, Instantly sequencer, Claude agents (reply second opinion,
  first-note writer, column mapping). 68 tests pass incl. the full end-to-end loop; `tsc` clean.
- Dashboard (`apps/web`): owner view (Home, Unibox, Opportunities, Sequence, Recovered, Settings),
  operator console, onboarding. Builds; checked in a browser at 1280px and 390px.

**Decisions this iteration (why)**
- Tree service is the flagship trade; every trade runs on the same engine via its playbook. Tree has the most
  dead quotes per shop (~39% of estimates never convert), a low close rate on blind leads, hazard work that
  truly gets worse, and a winter slow season. Ticket size is *not* the reason — big quotes are down-weighted.
- The free round of 150 is ranked by likelihood to reply (the trial's job is proof), capped at 40% per leak so
  the owner sees wins from several leaks, dead quotes included. Paying accounts rank by expected dollars.
- "Big ticket" is relative to each shop's own typical job (4x median), never a national number.
- Quotes older than 180 days never repeat the old price; the note offers a fresh look and the owner's hand-off
  says to re-price.
- Oak pruning is never offered April–October (oak wilt); ash-borer treatment timed to May/early June.
- House-wash re-service moved from 12 to 36 months (owners report 3–10 years); aerobic septic on a 12-month clock.
- Every human reply gets a Claude second opinion (rules are ~83% right on unseen mail); a stop always stands and
  a possible "yes" is never dropped.
- Instantly: one workspace serves many businesses, so `skip_if_in_workspace` is off.
- Claims library: 10 sourced claims; 12 banned stats, now enforced by the note linter.

**Next**
- Research synthesis → Breakage & Offer Blueprint (judge-panel the offer framing).
- Engine test suites for breakage/cadence/copy/ledger/reports/runtime + a 10k-row performance test.
- Worker tick speed (≈0.75s per business per tick in the e2e test).
- Adversarial review + fix passes; publish blueprint and demo.
